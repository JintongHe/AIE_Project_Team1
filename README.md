# AIE_Project_Team1

## Environment Setup
1. git clone https://github.com/JintongHe/AIE_Project_Team1.git
2. git clone https://github.com/robfiras/ls-iq.git
3. git clone https://github.com/robfiras/loco-mujoco.git
2. In the terminal
```angular2html
cd loco-mujoco
pip install -e .
cd ..
cd ls-iq
pip install -e .
```
The environment should be good now

Starting code is at ```./test```

I think a good environment for us is ```HumanoidTorque.walk```
but feel free to try other environments
